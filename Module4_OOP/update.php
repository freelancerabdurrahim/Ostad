Create a PHP class called Car that has three private properties: $make, $model, and $year. Define a constructor method to set the values of these properties when a new object is created. Also, define six additional methods: get_make(), get_model(), get_year(), set_make(), set_model(), and set_year(). The get_ methods should allow us to retrieve the values of the private properties, while the set_ methods should allow us to update them. Finally, define a method called display_info() that echoes out the car's make, model, and year.
Create a Car object with the make, model, and year of a 2015 Toyota Corolla. Call the display_info() method to display the car's information.
Then, use the set_make() and set_model() methods to update the car's make and model to a 2015 Honda Civic. Call the display_info() method again to display the updated car information.
